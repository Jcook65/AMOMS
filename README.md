  This project is being written in PYTHON 2.7 
                                            
***********************************************

This is using Python's web framework, Django.
To install from console: pip install django
To check Django is installed: django-admin --version

I highly suggest using IDEA's Pycharm IDE.

To develop please branch off of Development and give the branch your name.
From your branch you may branch off and make features or do as you please.
When you are ready to commit a feature you may push back to the development
branch. I will then commit and push to the master when I've decided it is
safe. Once master is up to date, the dev branches will pull from development
and continue the process again.

If you want to learn about Django this is a good tutorial:
